Instantiate a new `Cluster` object.

== Configuring the client

To configure the client, instantiate a new `Cluster` object:

[source,go]
----
myCluster, _ := gocb.Connect("couchbase://10.4.4.1")
----

== Connecting to a bucket

To connect to a bucket, call the `OpenBucket()` method against your `Cluster` instance, passing in the name of the bucket that you want to connect to, along with any password.
If a blank bucket name is specified, the default bucket is opened.
The following example shows how to connect to a bucket:

[source,go]
----
myBucket, _ := myCluster.OpenBucket("beer-sample", "")
----

In addition to the bucket name, you can optionally include the bucket password if one has been defined, as shown in the following example:

[source,go]
----
myBucket, _ := myCluster.OpenBucket("default", "password");
----

== Configuring SSL

To configure SSL, pass an SSL scheme with your connection string when creating your cluster object.

[source,go]
----
myCluster, _ := gocb.Connect("couchbases://10.1.1.1")
myBucket, _ := myCluster.OpenBucket("default", "")
----
