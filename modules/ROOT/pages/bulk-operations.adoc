= Bulk operations
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can perform bulk operations by using the various [.api]`*Op` structures along with the `Do` method of your Bucket object.

The `*Op` structures work by accepting the same parameters that are accepted by the individual methods.
Following the execution of the `Do` method against the list of `*Op` structures, the remaining fields will be filled out with the results of the operations.

Here is an example that shows how to perform two inserts simultaneously:

[source,go]
----
myBucket, _ := myCluster.OpenBucket("default", "")

var items []gocb.BulkOp
items = append(items, &gocb.InsertOp{Key: "document_name_1", Value: "Hello World 1"})
items = append(items, &gocb.InsertOp{Key: "document_name_2", Value: "Hello World 2"})

err := bucket.Do(items)
----
