= Handling timeouts
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Timeouts occur when an operation cannot be processed fast enough.

An operation cannot be processed fast enough either due to connection issues to the appropriate Couchbase Server node or due to high server loads.
The SDK will attempt to retry an operation internally upon recoverable failures such as timeouts.
However, if there is a persistent issue, a timeout will be emitted to the client.
When this occurs, you should push this error back upon the request initiator (the front end) to be attempted at some later date.

NOTE: Due to nature of the Couchbase system, it is not suggested to perform manual retries upon receiving a timeout because it will likely simply aggravate whatever issue caused the initial error.
