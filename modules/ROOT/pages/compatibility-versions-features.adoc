== Couchbase Go SDK

The Couchbase Go SDK in accordance with established best practices within the Go Community is installed and managed using gopkg.
As a result, specific versions are installed within a specific developer environment.
We follow http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning^] and typically release an update of the SDK the third Tuesday of each month.
In order to update your specific developer environment to this new version, you will have to instruct Go to `go get` that specific version.
For further information, please reference the section on installation.
