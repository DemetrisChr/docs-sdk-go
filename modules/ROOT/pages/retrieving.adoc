= Retrieving documents
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
You can retrieve documents by using regular reads or replica reads.

== Regular reads

Perform regular reads by using the `Get()` method.
Regular reads enable you to retrieve a previously stored document from your active data set.

The following example shows a regular read:

[source,go]
----
myBucket, _ := myCluster.OpenBucket("default", "")
var myValue interface{}
cas, err := myBucket.Get("document_name", &myValue)
----

== Replica reads

You perform replica reads by using the `GetReplica()` method.
Replica reads enable you to retrieve a previously stored document by querying the replica copies of this document rather than the active one.
This is not guaranteed to be consistent but does permit a level of recovery in case the primary server is not reachable.

The following example shows a replica read, where the first responding server is the one used.

[source,go]
----
myBucket, _ := myCluster.OpenBucket("default", "")
var myValue interface{}
cas, err := myBucket.GetReplica("document_name", &myValue, 0)
----
