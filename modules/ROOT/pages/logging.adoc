= Setting up logging
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Go SDK currently doesn't support highly detailed logging.

While the Go SDK does not currently support highly detailed logging, it allows the specification of a logging endpoint that will log various details from within the SDK to aid in the diagnosis of issues that may occur.
To utilize this functionality, execute the code (similar to the one presented) at the beginning of your application and prior to any use of the `gocb` or `gocbcore` library methods.

Note that in this example we use a built-in logger that will log all messages to standard output, but you can use any structure that matches the `gocbcore.Logger` interface.

[source,go]

import (
   "github.com/couchbaselabs/gocb/gocbcore"
)

func main() {
   gocbcore.SetLogger(gocbcore.DefaultStdOutLogger())

   // Use the gocb library.
}
