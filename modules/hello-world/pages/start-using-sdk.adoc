:navtitle: Start Using the SDK

[abstract]
The Couchbase C SDK (libcouchbase - LCB) enables you to interact with a Couchbase Server cluster from the C language.
It is also used by the Node.js, PHP, and Python SDKs to communicate with the Couchbase Server.

== Installing the SDK

These pages cover the first _Developer Preview_ of LCB 3.0 (DP1).
As such they are likely to change without notice.
The DP1 code _should not_ be used in production.
